# data-analyst-port
This repository was created to house different projects I worked on while going through my learning process in Data Analysis.

Coursera data analyst curriculum helps me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, form meaningful conclusions, and clearly convey crucial results, which prepares me for a career as a data analyst. 

This portfolio shows my learning progress and also because were not created at the period of learning due to lack of orientation might have similar or close data while in the reality are farther apart, I'm honing my skills in R, Python and its data analysis tools (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib), as well as SQL.

Tips: I would recommend installing r studio and python with the following libraries numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
